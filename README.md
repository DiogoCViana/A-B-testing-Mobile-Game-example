### Project Description

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project analyzing player retention in the mobile puzzle game "Cookie Cats" developed by Tactile Entertainment. In this project, our primary aim is to determine the optimal level at which to place a gate within the game to minimize its impact on player retention. This analysis is essential for ensuring a seamless player experience and maximizing player engagement.

**Dataset Source:**

The dataset utilized for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, where a user made it available after completing a project from Datacamp. It contains detailed information on player behavior within the game, including progression levels, retention rates, and other pertinent metrics.

**About Cookie Cats:**

"Cookie Cats" is a widely popular mobile puzzle game characterized by its engaging "connect three" style gameplay. Players are tasked with matching tiles of the same color to clear the board and progress to higher levels. Throughout the game, players encounter gates designed to either necessitate a specific waiting period or prompt an in-app purchase before further progression. Notably, the first gate in the game is initially set at level 30.

**Objective:**

Our main objective is to identify the most suitable level for placing the gate within "Cookie Cats" to minimize its impact on player retention. To achieve this, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of the results obtained from an A/B test, wherein the location of the first gate in the game was moved from level 30 to level 40.

**Libraries Used:**

For conducting the analysis and generating insights, we utilize the following libraries:

- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computing and array operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
- SciPy: For statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Project Progress:**

Our project follows a structured approach, starting with data profiling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and player behavior patterns. We then proceed to define the business problem, conduct hypothesis testing to assess the impact of moving the gate, and draw conclusions based on statistical analyses.

**Conclusion:**

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we find no significant difference in retention rates between the gate_30 and gate_40 groups when the gate is moved from level 30 to level 40. Therefore, we do not recommend relocating the gate, as it is unlikely to have a substantial impact on player retention.

Stay tuned for further updates and insights from our analysis in this GitHub repository!
