# A-B-testing-Mobile-Game-example
In this notebook I will complete a full analysis of the mobile game Cookie Cats, and it will include the profiling part, exploratory data analysis, and A/B testing.
The objective of this analysis is to answer the business problem statement:  Our business problem involves deciding if the first gate in the mobile game Cookie Cats should be moved from level 30 to level 40 and understand the impact this change would have on player retention.
Therefore, by the end of the notebook, I will provide a recommendation based on the findings.
